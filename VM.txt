We provide two variants of the Virtual Machine (VM) Image:

The first variant comes with all the necessary build tools and also includes GuestAdditions. 
GuestAdditions allows for easy transfer (drag and drop) of files between the VM and the HOST, as well as copying from clipboard between the VM and HOST. 
You can enable these features from Menu->Devices->Shared Clipboard and Menu->Devices->Drag and Drop.
